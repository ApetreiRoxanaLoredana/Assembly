# Assembly Problems Repository

This repository contains my collection of solved Assembly language problems, organized into various sections based on specific topics and difficulty levels. The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and practice with Assembly programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into the following sections:

- **Bitwise Operations:** This section includes problems that focus on bitwise operations, such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts. These problems helped me understand fundamental data manipulation techniques.

- **Control Flow and String Operations:** Here, I've tackled problems involving control flow structures (loops, conditionals) and string manipulations. These exercises are crucial for mastering the creation of complex and efficient programs.

- **Byte, Word, Doubleword, and Quadword Operations:** Problems in this section deal with operations on various data sizes. Through these problems, I've practiced arithmetic and logical operations on bytes, words, doublewords, and quadwords, gaining a deeper understanding of low-level data handling.

- **System Function Calls and File Operations:** This section contains problems related to system calls and file operations. These tasks are essential for learning how to interact with the operating system and manage files using Assembly language.

- **Miscellaneous Problems:** A collection of diverse problems that do not fit neatly into the other categories. These problems have allowed me to explore advanced topics and various applications of Assembly language, including algorithms, data structures, and hardware interfacing.
